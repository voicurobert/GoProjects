/*
A list is a sequence of elements. Each element can be connected to another with a link in a forward or backward
direction. The element can have other payload properties. This data structure is a basic type of container.
Lists have a variable length and developer can remove or add elements more easily than an array.
Data items within a list need not be contiguous in memory or on disk.
