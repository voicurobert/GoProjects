/*
A backtracking algorithm solves a problem by constructing the solution incrementally.
Multiple options are evaluated, and the algorithm chooses to go to the next component of the solution through
recursion. Backtracking can be a chronological type or can traverse the paths, depending on the problem that you are solving.

Backtracking is an algorithm that finds candidate solutions and rejects a candidate on the basis of its
feasibility and validity. Backtracking is useful in scenarios such as finding a value in an unordered table. It is faster than a brute force algorithm,
which rejects a large number of solutions in an iteration. Constraint satisfaction problems such as parsing, rules engine, knapsack problems,
and combinatorial optimization are solved using ^backtracking.
